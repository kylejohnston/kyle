				<h1>Idea Bucket Website</h1>
				<p>In 2011, I was invited to collaborate with a newly-formed innovation team to design and develop an internal idea-sharing website. The goal of the project was to allow anyone in the company share ideas for new products, features, and services.</p>
				<p>The website is still in use today and many ideas have advanced to real-world applications.</p>
				<p><strong>My role:</strong> Website Design, Front End Development</p>

				<h2>Homepage</h2>
				<p>The homepage features the most recent ideas, all sortable by popularity, particular categories, and more.</p>
				<p>Content can be submitted in three categories:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Add an Idea:</strong> Used to submit ideas for new products, features or services.</li>
					<li><strong>Share Knowledge:</strong> Used to share links to external news and information about new products, technologies, and more.</li>
					<li><strong>Submit a Challenge:</strong> Used to gather ideas around distinct challenges.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>Once an item is submitted, associates can discuss each idea via comments and vote on ideas, which determines popularity.</p>
				<p>A small team is responsible for reviewing each idea submitted, then assigning promising ideas to specific teams for further exploration.</p>
