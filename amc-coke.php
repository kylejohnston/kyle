					<h2>The Challenge</h2>
					<p>Coke and AMC ran a quarterly digital and in-theatre campaign to encourage teens to purchase Coke and popcorn. However, their last few attempts fell short of their goals.</p>
					<p>During the implementation of AMC&rsquo;s email marketing program, AMC asked the team at DEG to develop a new approach for their upcoming campaign.</p>
					<h2>The Approach</h2>
					<p>After studying earlier campaigns and scanning social platforms for reactions to those efforts, we came back to AMC with two key suggestions:
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Focus on the core audience.</strong> In previous campaigns, AMC sent the offer to <em>everyone</em>, but only teens could redeem the offer. We suggested they show the offer to teens and their parents, and leave everyone else out of the picture.</li>
						<li><strong>Speak to teens in an authentic voice.</strong> AMC&rsquo;s voice in previous campaigns read like uncool adults tying to speak with teens. We suggested they adopt a digital-centric voice, inspired by memes and GIFs with visuals influenced by popular social platforms.</li>
					</ol>

					<h2>The Results</h2>
					<p>By focusing the campaign on the core audience and speaking to them with an authentic voice and relevant visuals, we delivered record-breaking results:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>In targeted emails, unique opens and total clicks were the highest of any previous AMC &amp; Coke promotion.</li> 
						<li>Social posts drove a 189% increase in brand engagement with an accompanying increase in site visits.</li>
						<li>Successful redemptions of the offer increased 38%, handily beating their targets.</li>
					</ul>
