				<h2>Website Redesign</h2>
				<p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> <a href="https://www.waddell.com">Waddell &amp; Reed</a> &#8212; an asset management and financial planning company &#8212; had an outdated, disorganized, and difficult to manage web experience that was confusing for both customers and employees.</p>

					<h2>Where We Started</h2>
					<p>Waddell &amp; Reed had more than 4 separate websites, all hard-coded, and none were mobile-optimized. We started by evaluating their external and internal audiences and matrix of sites and came away with three main objectives for the new web experience:
					<ul>
						<li>Increase positive brand recognition through improved website content and functionality</li>
						<li>Allow for efficiency in updating website content</li>
						<li>Improve marketing efforts using SEO, personalized content, and more</li>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<h2>Sharing Progress</h2>
					<p>As we progressed through the initial design phase of the project, we used <a href="http://styletil.es">style tiles</a> to quickly iterate ideas and gain client approvals. The UI team used our style tiles to populate a development tool called <a href="http://patternlab.io">Pattern Lab</a>. This helped us quickly validate design decisions and provided internal and external stakeholders with prototypes that could be tested on different devices.</p>
					<p>This highly collaborative process ensured all stakeholders had a clear understanding of how the desktop experience translated to mobile and helped avoid late-stage changes that could have derailed the aggressive timeline.</p>

					<h2>The Results</h2>
					<p>Launched in September, 2016, Waddell &amp; Reed&rsquo;s redesigned website features strategically organized content within an engaging user experience and design. The investment in improving Waddell.com allowed Waddell &amp; Reed to focus on their most important investments: those of its clients.</p>
