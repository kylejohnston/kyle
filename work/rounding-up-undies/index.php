				<h1>Rounding Up Undies</h1>
				<h2>Logo Design</h2>
				<p>Rounding Up Undies is a charity that provides hygiene kits to young women in Uganda and Mali. The team at Rounding Up Undies approached me about designing a logo that could be used for their hygiene kit packaging, promotional materials and social presence.</p>

					<h2>Research &amp; Sketches</h2>
					<p>I started by researching Ugandan art and textiles to gain an understanding of dominant colors and patterns present in the culture. At the same time, I began sketching ideas for shapes and type treatments.</p>

					<h2>Design Exploration</h2>
					<p>Based on my research and initial sketches, I explored a variety of visual directions and type treatments. At this stage, I started to incorporate hand-drawn shapes and patterns. I also realized that when the underwear shape was 'folded', it resembled the shape of Africa, so it became a key element in my design recommendations.</p>

					<h2>Logo Design Options</h2>
					<p>After exploring many design ideas, I selected three options and presented them to the Rounding Up Undies team. They quickly gravitated to one design. After a round of refinements, we had a design that everyone loved.</p>

					<h2>Final Logo Design</h2>
					<p>After a few additional finishing touches (details matter) &#8212; I delivered the final logo along with brand guidelines that ensure the logo will look great as it's used to support and promote the important mission of Rounding Up Undies.</p>
					<h3>Impact</h3>
					<p>Within the first 6 hours of promoting Rounding Up Undies using the new logo, they raised $1,000 â€“ and continue to help women in need to this day.</p>
