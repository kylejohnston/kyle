				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>I’m a passionate and unflappable creative leader and designer with twenty years of broad-ranging design experience including a rich background in practicing and leading design, creative strategy, and operational leadership and development. I’ve utilized my passion for communication design, user-centered design, and team leadership to successfully build, manage, and mentor diverse teams in both in-house and agency environments.</p>
				<p>Currently, I’m the owner and principal designer at flow14, an independent branding and design studio that specializes in helping clients connect with their audiences through thoughtfully designed communications, including websites, branding, and more.</p>
				<p>Prior to flow14, I served as the Director of Creative Services at Vista Outdoor, a leader in the outdoor sports and recreation markets; the Creative Director at DEG, a rapidly growing digital marketing and advertising agency based in Kansas City; and Creative Director at Garmin. In my time at Garmin, I had a front row seat to its explosive growth – from a niche brand known for its early innovations in Marine, Aviation and Outdoor GPS electronics, to its current standing as a global brand. Similarly, the teams I led there grew – from a small, scrappy band of web designers to a team of over 50, comprised of art directors, copywriters, UX specialists, motion designers, photographers and videographers.</p>
