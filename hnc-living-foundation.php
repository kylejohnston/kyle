				<h1>HNC Living Foundation</h1>
				<h2>Website Redesign</h2>
				<p>What do you do when your nonprofit has successfully helped more than 1,200 head and neck cancer patients with their treatment and recovery, but you’re ready to expand beyond your local roots?</p>
				<p>For <a href="https://www.hncliving.org">HNC Living Foundation</a>&#8212;a nonprofit who partners with healthcare providers to fund grants that help head and neck cancer patients&#8212;the answer was a modern website designed to attract more donors and find new partners.</p>
				<p><strong>Contributions:</strong> Research, Design, Copywriting, SEO</p>

					<h2>The Challenge</h2>
					<p>HNC Living, a Kansas City-based nonprofit founded in 2015, has successfully helped more than 1,200 head and neck cancer patients live life fully by funding more than $555,000 in grants for treatment, therapy, and support services.</p>
					<p>However, their website didn’t effectively communicate their mission, wasn’t driving donations, and wasn’t easy to navigate.</p>
					<p>HNC Living asked flow14 to reimagine their website and give them an effective platform to increase donations, reach more partners and patients, and grow nationally.</p>

					<h2>Process: Project Vision</h2>
					<p>For the kickoff meeting, I developed a project vision to help drive a conversation about HNC Living’s audiences and goals. Based on my experience using their site, I shared  ideas for improving the organization, calls to action, and more.</p>

					<h2>Research &amp; Auditing</h2>
					<p>I researched scores of nonprofits in cancer care and other areas to understand different models for site organization, content, and calls to action. This research, informed by HNC Living’s goals and audiences, led to a new navigation structure that directly addressed their key audiences: donors, healthcare providers, and patients.</p>
					<p>Next, a SEO audit underscored the benefits of this approach, and informed a content strategy that spoke more clearly to their audiences and allowed for hyper-relevant calls to action.</p>

					<h2>Copywriting &amp; Content Strategy</h2>
					<p>For the all-important website content, I created a collaborative document that allowed project stakeholders to provide real-time suggestions and edits.</p>
